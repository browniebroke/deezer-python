# Contributing

Contributions are welcome, and they are greatly appreciated! Every little helps, and credit will always be given.

You can contribute in many ways:

## Types of Contributions

### Report Bugs

Report bugs on the [issues page]. If you are reporting a bug, please include:

- Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in troubleshooting.
- Detailed steps to reproduce the bug.

### Fix Bugs

Look through the GitHub issues for bugs. Anything tagged with "bug" is open to whoever wants to implement it.

### Implement Features

Look through the GitHub issues for features. Anything tagged with "enhancement" is open to whoever wants to implement it.

### Write Documentation

This module could always use more documentation, whether as part of the official docs, in docstrings, or other.

### Submit Feedback

The best way to send feedback is to file a ticket on the [issues page]. If you are proposing a feature:

- Explain how it would work.
- Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement.
- Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that contributions are welcome ðŸ™‚

## Get Started!

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up `deezer-python` for local development.

1. Fork the repo on GitHub.

2. Clone your fork locally:

   ```bash
   $ git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/deezer-python.git
   ```

3. Install the dependencies with [Poetry]

   ```bash
   $ poetry install -E tornado -E docs
   ```

4. Create a branch for local development:

   ```bash
   $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
   ```

   Now you can make your changes locally.

5. When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass our tests and that the doc builds. The easiest way to do that is by running [tox] environments:

   ```bash
   $ poetry run tox -e lint,docs,py38
   ```

   It will run our linters ([flake8] and [black]), build the docs and run the tests

6. Commit your changes, quoting GitHub issue in the commit message, if applicable, and push your branch to GitHub:

   ```bash
   $ git add .
   $ git commit -m "feat(something): your detailed description of your changes"
   $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
   ```

   Note: the commit message should follow [the conventional commits][conventional-commits] specs, this is to enable the automation of releases. We run [`commitlint` on CI][commitlint] which will validate the commit messages.

7. Submit a pull request on GitHub.

## Obtain an API token

If you want to work on a feature that requires authentication, you'll need to obtain an API token to perform authenticated requests using the `oauth.py` script. The script will take you through the OAuth flow, display and save the API token at the end.

First, you'll need to have a dedicated app in the [Deezer developer portal][deezer-developers-myapps], create one with the following redirect URL after authentication: `http://localhost:8080/oauth/return`.

Once created, get the application ID as well as the secret key and call the script with them:

```bash
$ python oauth.py --app-id APP_ID --app-secret SECRET_KEY
```

Authorise the app in your browser. You should then should be redirected to a simple HTML page with your API token. The script also save the API token locally in the `.env` file. This is convenient to generate cassettes when writing new tests locally.

## Pull Request Guidelines

Feel free to open the pull request as soon as possible, but please be explicit if it's still a work in progress, we recommend draft pull requests. Please try to:

1. Include tests for feature or bug fixes.
2. Update the documentation if for any significant API changes.
3. Ensure tests are passing on continuous integration.

## Create a New Release

The deployment should be automated and can be triggered from the Semantic Release workflow in GitHub. The next version will be based on [the commit logs][commit-log]. This is done by [python-semantic-release] via a GitHub action.
